# Building-a-Music-Player

Let's explore some key string and array methods, including find(), forEach(), map(), and join(). Mastery of these methods is essential for building dynamic web applications.

In this project, you will develop a basic MP3 player using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This project will introduce you to core concepts such as audio playback management, playlist handling, and the implementation of features like play, pause, next, previous, and shuffle. Additionally, you will learn how to dynamically update the user interface in response to the currently playing song.
